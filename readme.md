Embed a player with your audio into your social site posts.

## Description ##

<em>Notice: This plugin works only for Twitter right now. As of December 2017, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/1963535797258090/">Facebook no longer allows embedded videos</a> to play in external link previews (including those from YouTube and Videos). You can still use Sound Shares to embed audio players in tweets.</em>

Sound Shares adds an audio player to social-site shares of your posts.

Enter an audio-file URL into a post's Sound Shares box. This plugin then inserts tags into your post's HTML so social sites embed your audio in their link previews.

<em>Note: Works only for secure HTTPS sites.</em>

### Settings screen ###

The Sound Shares screen in your Dashboard (under Settings) lets you restrict the use of Sound Shares by user roles, post types, and category (defaults: admin, 'post', and all categories). This is also where you enter your Twitter handle and your Facebook App and ID number to track usage in Facebook Sharing Insights.

### Post box ###

The Sound Shares box in the Edit Post screen has a field for the audio URL (internal or external, must be HTTPS) to embed at social sites. You can make the audio's title, author, and image different than the post's.

Once published you will see links to the debug tools at Facebook and Twitter, which show you how your post displays in their link previews.

### Facebook App and Admin IDs ###
Facebook requires an App ID (get one from your <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/redirect/dashboard">Facebook App Dashboard</a>) to track <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/insights">Facebook Sharing Insights</a>. You control who can view these Insights with Facebook users IDs (find IDs at the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/?method=GET&amp;path=me%3Ffields%3Did%2Cname">Graph Explorer</a>). Enter Facebook App and User IDs in the Settings: Sound Shares screen. You can check your posts' meta tags and link-previews with Facebook's [Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/).

### Twitter whitelist ###
Twitter must approve ("whitelist") your site before it embeds an audio player. The quickest way to get [Player Card Approval](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/player-card-approval) is to enter the URL of an audio post (one with an audio file in its Sound Shares box) into Twitter's [Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator). If your site is not whitelisted, use the "Request Approval" button to begin the process -- which will take a day or more.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does this work with tags inserted by SEO plugins? ###
Sound Shares works with Jetpack, Yoast SEO, and All in One SEO Pack. It changes their Facebook Open Graph and Twitter Card types so social-site link preview embed your audio.

### Can this plugin insert all the social meta tags? ###
If you are not using an SEO plugin to insert social meta tags for Facebook and Twitter, Sound Shares can do that for you. Use the Settings page.

### How can I contribute to Sound Shares? ###
Sound Shares is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/hearvox/sound-shares). Pull Requests welcome.

### How can I translate Postscript? ###
This plugin is internationalized (default: English). Please contribute a translation in your language.

The WordPress.org Polyglots Team maintains a comprehensive [Translatorâ€™s Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/). All text strings in this plugin are localized, following the guidelines of the Wordpress.org Plugin Handbook's [Internationalization section](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/).

### Dev notes ###
This plugin has one filter: `'soundshares_meta_tags'`, an array of values for the HTML meta tags -- `includes/admin-options.php` has a usage example. See Twitter's [Player Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/player-card) and Facebook's [Open Graph protocol](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters) references.

Sound Shares filters other plugins' tags (Jetpack, Yoast SEO, and All in One SEO Pack) so the link preview can will embed media (`og:type` = `video.movie`, `twitter:card` = `player`). Facebook audio embeds use the default HTML audio player. For Twitter this plugin provides a custom player (`includes/player.html`). The meta box displays links to social-site link-preview debuggers after the post is published. (Try Facebook's "Scrape Again" button if your post's link-preview does not display a play button.)
