Embed an audio player in social sites when users share your posts.

== Description ==

Add an audio player into Facebook posts and Twitter tweets of your posts.

When you enter an audio file URL in a post's Sound Shares box, this plugin adds the HTML tags so social sites embed audio in their link previews.

*Note: Works only for secure HTTPS sites.*

= Settings screen =

The Sound Shares screen in your Dashboard (under Settings) lets you restrict the use of Sound Shares by user roles, post types, and category (defaults: admin, 'post', and all categories). This is also where you enter your Twitter handle and your Facebook App and ID number to track usage in Facebook Sharing Insights.

= Post box =

The Sound Shares box in the Edit Post screen has a field for the audio URL (internal or external, must be HTTPS) to embed at social sites. You can make the audio's title, author, and image different than the post's.

Once published you will see links to the debug tools at Facebook and Twitter, which show you how your post displays in their link previews.

== Installation ==

To install the use the Postscript plugin:

1. Upload the `sound-shares` directory and content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Setting: Sound Shares options screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with tags inserted by SEO plugins? =
Sound Shares works with Jetpack, Yoast SEO, and All in One SEO Pack. It changes their Facebook Open Graph and Twitter Card types so social-site link preview embed your audio.

= Can this plugin insert all the social meta tags? =
If you are not using an SEO plugin to insert social meta tags for Facebook and Twitter, Sound Shares can do that for you. Use the Settings page.

= How can I contribute to Sound Shares? =
Sound Shares is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/hearvox/sound-shares). Pull Requests welcome.

= How can I translate Postscript? =
This plugin is internationalized (default: English). Please contribute a translation in your language.

The WordPress.org Polyglots Team maintains a comprehensive [Translatorâ€™s Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/). All text strings in this plugin are localized, following the guidelines of the Wordpress.org Plugin Handbook's [Internationalization section](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/).

= Dev notes =
This plugin has one filter: `'soundshares_meta_tags'`, an array of values for the HTML meta tags -- `includes/admin-options.php` has a usage example. See Twitter's [Player Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/player-card) and Facebook's [Open Graph protocol](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters) references.

Sound Shares filters of the Jetpack, Yoast SEO, and All in One SEO Pack meta tags so that `og:type` and `twitter:card` values will embed media. Facebook audio embeds in the default HTML audio player. For Twitter this plugin provides a custom player (`includes/player.html`). The meta box displays links to social-site link-preview debuggers after the post is published. (Try Facebook's "Scrape Again" button if your post's link-preview does not display a play button.)
